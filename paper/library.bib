	abstract = {In this article, we discuss a method for calculating transfer integrals for pairs of molecules based on Zerner's Independent Neglect of Differential Overlap Hamiltonian which requires only a single self-consistent field calculation on an isolated molecule to be performed to determine the transfer integral for a pair of molecules. This method is compared with results obtained by projection of the pair of molecules' molecular orbitals onto the vector space defined by the molecular orbitals of each isolated molecule. The two methods are found to be in good agreement using three compounds as model systems: pentacene, ethylene, and hexabenzocoronene. © 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Int J Quantum Chem, 2008},
