\experiment{PCBM-CG}

Continuuing the Girifalco CG C60 simulation work, the idea is to supplement the
single point forcefield by an interaction site to 'kinda' represent PBM.

This is done by defining a couple of atomtypes --- the C60 is standard Girifalco:
\begin{verbatim}
[ atomtypes ]
;type    mass    charge       ptype          sigma      epsilon
 C60    720.60   0.00           A           0.89535      26.822830
 PBM    190.00   0.00           A           0.5          10.0
\end{verbatim}

You then connect these things together with 'bonds' to specify their location,
and build up the bis / tris by specifying angles between the sidechains to
preserve the correct structure.

\subexperiment{Pymol Rendering}

Overlapping the two representations, and drawing spheres at the vdW radii (hard
sphere approximation) of the two coarse grain atoms, you get something a little
like this:

}
\end{figure}

In Pymol, going from the output PDB files, which open as orange and green blobs, you want to:

\begin{verbatim}
show spherse, all
alter elem P, vdw=2.5
alter elem C, vdw=4.47675
rebuild
\end{verbatim}

All together, with 10 mono PCBM on a wall, this looks something like:

them. MD at 300K, just to show behaviour and packing arrangement.  }
\end{figure}

\subexperiment{Parameterisation}

So, we basically have three free parameters with this paramterisation: Strength
of 'PBM' LJ potential, eqm distance of PBM LJ potential, and size of bond for
fullere---PBM.

LJ potentials are combined by geometric average of the $r^6$ and $r^{12}$
parameters (multiply them together + then sqrt) [type 1], or by the Lorentz-Beerthelot
rules (arithmetic avg for $\sigma$, geometric for $\epsilon$) [type 2]. 
But one can also
define the pairs explicitly in gromacs.

I guess what we really want to do is make use of the atomistic monoPCBM
forcefield, and fit the 3 parameters to reproduce similar CoM RDFs between the
CG representation and the atomistic. That should get the distances correct, ish, at least.

\subexperiment{RDFs}

So let's see how they compare currently...

\subexperiment{CG-RDF}

So make an index with 'a C' to 'make\_ndx -f confout.gro'.

And it looks quite interesting, you see the clear C60-C60 peak at just over
1nm, and then a 2nd peak which I imagine is from fullerene-fullerene with a PBM
stuck in the way. Perhaps. This is C60-C60 centre distance don't forget, no
contri from PBM:C60 or PBM:PBM.

\subexperiment{3D CG sim}

So the FF with the three variables are: $\sigma=$ 0.5, $\epsilon=$ 10.0, bond = 0.5

Looks like:

And running under MD, it looks like:

Ok, did 10ns of MD, the RDF is now:

Just realised I'd be in remiss if I didn't do equiv. for a pure C60 simulation. Rather than reuse the stuff with Joe, I may as well restart a job from exact same initial conditions as this one...

\end{figure}

\subexperiment{Compare to Atomistic...}

Hmm, bit challenging --- need to build index files.

PCBM has 88 atoms (therefore, 60 C60, 28 PBM).

Awk script to make index for C60 looked like:
\begin{verbatim}
BEGIN{
  for (i=0;i<99;i++)
     for (a=1;a<61;a++)
         print i*88+a
}
{}

for PBM:
BEGIN{
  for (i=0;i<99;i++)
     for (a=1;a<=28;a++)
         print 60+i*88+a
}
{}
\end{verbatim}

And so now we go back to the CG simulations and reproduce the same:

\labday{7-1-11}

\subexperiment{Single monoPCBM-atomistic}

To check whether the RDFs included within single molecule contributions, I
looked at the C--C, C--P, P--P distances for a single PCBM from the atomistic
simulation (with -rdf mol\_com, and building an index with 1--60, 61--88).

This gave null results for C--C and P--P (as expected), and a value of 6.34 \AA
for C--P, which is a sample of the 'bonded' length between the C60 and PBM (CoM) on a single molecule.

}
\end{figure}

In the above assembly RDF, the C--P shortest distance has a strong peak at 6.34
\AA. There's a second bump around 7.6 \AA, perhaps this could be the
inter-molecular C60-PBM closest approach?
