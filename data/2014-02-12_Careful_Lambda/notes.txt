A real pain to get T4T4T4 to converge!
Now I have the geometry (SCF=QC), but the neutral energy on ion geometry doesn't want to converge. Perhaps the saved structure is a long way away from the target? I've tried with different options, using a guess or the check, and different methods of converge (SCF=).

Off for the night...
